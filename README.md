basics of probability
Data is the main part of probability and statistics, without it, we can't do anything.
you must download the CSV  file  before running This Jupyter Notebook,to not make any error.
This Jupyter Notebook include  explain for :.
Mean :
"Mean" is commonly known as "average",
Mean Symbol: The mean is represented as x-bar, xÌ„.
Mean = (sum of all data point) / (number of data point)
Trimmed mean:
"Trimmed mean" is a method of averaging that removes a small 
designated percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean.
Median:
"Median" is method calculates the median (middle value) of the given data set.
Variation:
"Variation" is used to represent a measurement of the spread between numbers in a dataset.
In fact, the variance measures how far each number if from the mean of all numbers.
Standar deviation:
"Standar deviation" is square root of Variance.
Range:
"Range" is values (maximum - minimum) along an axis.
the q-th percentile of the data along the specified axis.
Median Absolution Deviation MAD.
Mode:
The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.
correlation matrix.
some of the basic probabilities:
probabilities = (number of event) / (number of sambel)
